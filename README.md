This is my blokchain project for Decentralized banking with a working graphical user interface. Its main functionality is staking tokens.
The project comprises of several smart contracts (written in sodility language) with generic full stack development for GUI.
It is built with React, Solidity (programming languge), truffle framework and work with ganance test network with metamask browser extension.
The node_module files are stored in .gitignore to save time while updating the project.

Thanks to Clarian for his udemy course on building complete decentralized application.
