This is my blockchain project for Decentralized banking with a fully-functional graphical user interface. Its main functionality is staking tokens. The project comprises several smart contracts (written in solidity language) with generic full-stack development for GUI. It is built with React, Solidity (programming language), and Truffle framework and works with the Ganache test network with Metamask browser extension. The node_module files are stored in .gitignore to save time while updating the project.

Thanks to Clarian for his Udemy course on building complete decentralized applications.
